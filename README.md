# CNNClustering
Common nearest neighbor clustering 

The common nearest neighbor (CNN) clustering is a density-based cluster algorithm which yields a strict partitioning with ouliers. The algorithm has been specifically designed to analyze high-dimensional data sets, as for example data sets of molecular structures which have been produced by molecular dynamics simulations. The resulting clusters can also be used to construct a core-set discretization of the molecular conformational space.
